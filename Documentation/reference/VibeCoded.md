# AI-Assisted Development Disclosure

## Transparency Statement

This project was initially created as a personal pet project and has been significantly enhanced through the use of **Cursor**, an AI-powered coding assistant. We believe in full transparency about the development process and want to be clear about how this project was built.

## Development Approach

### Original Project
- The core concept, architecture decisions, and project planning were done by the project maintainer
- Initial implementation was a personal learning project for tracking Solana rewards

### AI Enhancement
- **Cursor AI** was used extensively to:
  - Implement features based on project specifications
  - Refactor and optimize existing code
  - Fix bugs and improve code quality
  - Generate documentation and comments
  - Assist with database schema design
  - Create UI/UX improvements

### Human Oversight
- All code was reviewed and approved by the project maintainer
- Project direction, feature planning, and architectural decisions remain human-driven
- AI suggestions were evaluated, modified, and integrated based on project requirements
- Testing and validation were performed by humans
