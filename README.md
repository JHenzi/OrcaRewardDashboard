## Features

- ~~Real-time tracking of COLLECT_FEES events from your Solana wallet~~
  - Using the free API tier we refresh every 2 hours!
- SQLite database storage for transaction history
- Web dashboard displaying total SOL and USDC rewards
- Live SOL price data from LiveCoinWatch
- Background fetching with configurable intervals
- Backfill functionality for historical data

### Bonus SOL Price Database/Scraper

We are using the LiveCoinWatch API to grab the price of SOL and stashing in a SQLite database for long term analysis and statistical display.

~~You can start the price fetcher, on a `screen` session, by executing this command(Note, this is NOT NEEDED if you are running app.py, it will dispatch the predictions and combined the logged output so you only have one script to run!):~~

```bash
python sol_price_fetcher.py
```

Intead launch `app.py` with python on a `screen` session. This will count the API calls that remain for the day and ask you how often it should fetch prices based on the math it does. I have it fetching the price of SOL every five minutes. You can then see a chart of the last 288 price fetches (24 hours @ 5 minutes between fetches), the standard deviation, 24 hour range, low, high and so forth at `http://localhost:5030/sol-tracker`.

- **🧠 Meta-Learning**: A higher-level model that learns which signals work best in different market conditions
- **📊 Ensemble Predictions**: Weighted combination of multiple models for more robust forecasts
- **🔄 Adaptive Learning**: Automatically adjust signal weights based on recent performance
- **⚡ Real-Time Optimization**: Continuously optimize the combination strategy as new data arrives

**The Future of Trading Intelligence**: Instead of choosing between RSI, RL agent, or bandit signals, you'll get a unified recommendation that intelligently combines all three based on what's working right now.

### Why Signal Performance Tracking Matters

**The Problem:** Trading signals are only as good as their track record. Without performance tracking, you can't know if a "BUY" signal is actually profitable or if it's just noise.

**The Solution:** The Signal Performance Tracker automatically:
1. **Logs every signal** when it's generated (RSI buy/sell/hold)
2. **Tracks outcomes** by checking price movements 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days later
3. **Calculates reliability metrics** including win rate, average return, and best/worst cases
4. **Displays results** in an easy-to-understand format on the SOL Tracker page

**What This Means for You:**
- **Make Informed Decisions**: See which signals have historically been profitable
- **Trust the Data**: Know if RSI buy signals actually lead to price increases
- **Continuous Improvement**: As more signals are tracked, reliability metrics become more accurate

**Example:** If RSI Buy signals show a 65% win rate with an average +2.3% return over 24 hours, you can confidently act on those signals. If RSI Sell signals show only 40% win rate, you might want to be more cautious.

> **Note:** Price prediction and contextual bandit features have been deprecated. See [Documentation/reference/DEPRECATED.md](Documentation/reference/DEPRECATED.md) for historical information.

### Signal Performance Tracker - Why It Matters

**The Challenge:** Trading signals are everywhere, but how do you know which ones to trust? A "BUY" signal might look promising, but without historical data, you're flying blind.

**The Solution:** Our Signal Performance Tracker automatically monitors every trading signal and tracks its outcome over time. This gives you **data-driven confidence** in your trading decisions.

**What Gets Tracked:**
- **RSI Signals**: Every time RSI generates a buy/sell/hold signal, we log it
- **Outcomes**: We check prices 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days later
- **Metrics**: Win rate, average return, best/worst cases are calculated automatically

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Trust the Data**: See which signals have actually been profitable historically
2. **Risk Assessment**: Know the best and worst case scenarios for each signal type
3. **Continuous Learning**: As more signals are tracked, reliability metrics become more accurate
4. **Informed Decisions**: Make trading decisions based on proven track records, not just current signals

**Example Use Case:**
- RSI Buy signals show **65% win rate** with **+2.3% average return** → High confidence to act
- RSI Sell signals show **40% win rate** with **-0.5% average return** → Be cautious, maybe wait for stronger signals
- RSI Hold signals show **55% win rate** → Neutral, confirms it's a good time to wait

This feature transforms the SOL Tracker from a simple signal generator into a **data-driven trading intelligence platform**.

### Example Use Case

_"Deposit a large amount into an [Orca.so](https://orca.so/) SOL/USDC pool. These pools are popular and generally pay consistent rewards. Use this application to track returns, and use the RSI-based trading signals to help determine when to reinvest rewards into SOL or hold USDC. For example, a liquidity range of $130 to $280 may be appropriate for 2024-2025. When SOL trades within that range, liquidity fees are generated, and this app provides clear trading signals based on technical indicators."_

This strategy illustrates how both passive income and technical analysis can coexist in a portfolio.

> **Note:** Historical features (price prediction, contextual bandit, automated trading) have been deprecated. See [Documentation/reference/DEPRECATED.md](Documentation/reference/DEPRECATED.md) for details.

### 🔥 Discovered Trading Rules - THE KILLER FEATURE

**This is what makes this project different from every other trading bot.**

Most AI trading systems are black boxes. They tell you "BUY" or "SELL" but you have no idea why. You're trusting a machine with your money without understanding its reasoning.

**Our system is different.** It uses Decision Tree analysis on the AI's historical decisions to extract human-readable trading rules that you can actually understand, verify, and trust.

![Discovered Trading Rules](images/TradingRules.png)

**Why This Changes Everything:**

1. **🧠 Transparency** - See exactly what conditions the AI has learned lead to profitable trades
   - "If Price Volatility <= 0.001 AND Hour Cos > 0.643 → BUY" (100% win rate, 26 samples)
   - No more trusting a black box—verify the logic yourself

2. **📊 Statistical Validation** - Every rule comes with performance metrics
   - **Win Rate** - What percentage of trades following this rule were profitable
   - **Sample Size** - How many times has this pattern occurred (statistical significance)
   - **Avg Return (1h/24h)** - Expected returns for both short and long horizons

3. **🎯 Actionable Intelligence** - Rules you can actually use
   - Set alerts when rule conditions are met
   - Combine multiple rules for higher confidence
   - Understand market timing (Hour Sin/Cos features encode time-of-day patterns)

4. **🔄 Continuous Learning** - Rules update as the AI learns
   - New patterns are discovered automatically
   - Poor-performing rules are filtered out
   - The system gets smarter over time

**How It Works:**

The system extracts rules by:
1. Joining AI decisions with actual price outcomes (1h and 24h later)
2. Training Decision Trees on price features, sentiment, and time features
3. Extracting human-readable rules from tree paths
4. Calculating win rates and average returns for each rule
5. Ranking rules by statistical significance (win rate × sample size)

**Features Analyzed:**
- **Price Change** - Recent price momentum
- **Price Volatility** - Market stability/chaos
- **Price Trend** - Overall direction
- **Sentiment Avg/Max/Min** - News sentiment signals
- **Hour Sin/Cos** - Time-of-day patterns (cyclical encoding)
- **Position State** - Current portfolio exposure

**This isn't just another trading signal.** This is the AI showing its work—letting you verify its reasoning and build trust in its decisions.

### Backfill Historical Data

Visit `http://localhost:5030/backfill_newer` to manually trigger fetching newer transactions.

### Training the RL Agent

The RL agent can be trained on historical data and retrained periodically to stay current with market patterns.

**Current Status (Updated 2025-12-06):**
- ✅ **Training Infrastructure Corrected** - All NaN issues resolved, attention mechanism fixed, model weights validated
- ✅ **Model Retrained & Deployed** - Model successfully retrained with corrected infrastructure (2025-12-06)
- ✅ **Predictions Generating** - 1h/24h return predictions are now live and updating automatically
- ✅ **Data Quality Improvements** - Missing price data automatically smoothed and interpolated
- ✅ **System Stable** - All numerical instabilities fixed, training runs smoothly without NaN issues
- ✅ **Production Ready** - System tested and validated, ready for real-world trading decisions

**Important: News Data Availability**
- ⚠️ **News data is limited** (2 days) compared to price data (5 months)
- ✅ **System handles missing news gracefully** - automatically pads with zeros
- ✅ **Model learns from price patterns first** - news enhances decisions later as data accumulates
- See [Documentation/reference/TRAINING_GUIDE.md](Documentation/reference/TRAINING_GUIDE.md) for details on handling missing news

**Initial Training:**
```bash
# Step 1: Prepare training data from historical databases
python -m rl_agent.training_data_prep

# Step 2: Train the model
python scripts/train_rl_agent.py --epochs 10
```

**What happens during training:**
- For timestamps with news (Nov 27-28): Uses actual news embeddings and sentiment
- For timestamps without news (July - Nov 26): Pads with zeros (model learns to ignore)
- Model trains successfully on price patterns, news enhances later

**Price Data Gap Filling & Smoothing:**
When the system is offline (e.g., server downtime), gaps in price data are automatically filled and smoothed during training data preparation:
- **Gap Detection**: Identifies missing price points when intervals exceed expected collection frequency
- **Delta-Based Interpolation**: Uses stored `delta_hour` and `delta_day` values to estimate price changes during gaps
- **Advanced Smoothing**: Applies weighted moving average smoothing to interpolated prices for more realistic training data
- **Automatic Processing**: Gap filling and smoothing enabled by default in `TrainingDataPrep.get_price_history()`
- **Configurable Limits**: Only fills gaps up to 24 hours (configurable via `max_gap_hours` parameter)
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures training data has consistent intervals with realistic price movements

This intelligent data processing ensures the AI model trains on high-quality, consistent data even when the server was offline, using delta values and advanced smoothing algorithms to produce realistic interpolated prices that maintain market dynamics.

**After Training:**
- Model is automatically loaded on app startup via `initialize_rl_agent()`
- **Automatic Prediction Generation** - Scheduled decision loop runs every hour, generating predictions automatically
- When predictions are generated, the model provides:
  - **1h return prediction** - Predicted price change in 1 hour (e.g., -0.21% means predicted 0.21% decrease)
  - **24h return prediction** - Predicted price change in 24 hours (e.g., -2.33% means predicted 2.33% decrease)
  - **Confidence scores** - For both predictions (0.0 to 1.0, higher = more confident)
- Predictions are stored in database and accessible via `/api/rl-agent/predictions`
- **Data Quality** - Missing price data is automatically smoothed and interpolated during training for consistent model performance

**Periodic Retraining:**
```bash
# Adaptive retraining (recommended - retrains when enough new data)
python scripts/retrain_rl_agent.py --mode adaptive

# Weekly retraining
python scripts/retrain_rl_agent.py --mode weekly --epochs 5

# Monthly retraining
python scripts/retrain_rl_agent.py --mode monthly --epochs 10
```

**Automation:**
Set up automated retraining with cron or systemd (see [Documentation/reference/RETRAINING_STRATEGY.md](Documentation/reference/RETRAINING_STRATEGY.md) for details).

**Documentation:**
- [Documentation/reference/TRAINING_GUIDE.md](Documentation/reference/TRAINING_GUIDE.md) - Complete guide to training on historical data

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Prediction Accuracy Stats Showing "No Data"

If prediction accuracy statistics (MAE, RMSE) are showing "No data" after the system has been running:

1. **Check if predictions exist:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/check_prediction_data.py
   ```
   This will show you:
   - Total predictions in database
   - How many have actual returns calculated
   - Sample of recent predictions
   - Whether data needs updating

2. **Backfill missing actual returns:**
   If predictions exist but don't have actual returns calculated:
   ```bash
   python scripts/backfill_prediction_actuals.py
   ```
   This script will:
   - Find all predictions missing 1h/24h actual returns
   - Look up actual prices from `sol_prices.db`
   - Calculate and update all missing actual returns
   - Show progress and final statistics

3. **Verify update loop is running:**
   - Check app logs for "Prediction actuals update loop started"
   - The loop runs every 15 minutes automatically
   - Check `/api/predictions/diagnostics` endpoint for status

4. **Common issues:**
   - **No predictions stored**: Make sure RL agent is making decisions (check `/api/rl-agent/decision`)
   - **Predictions exist but no actuals**: Run backfill script or wait for update loop
   - **Stats query looks at last 24h only**: Older predictions won't show in stats unless you increase the `hours` parameter

### Rules Not Being Discovered

If the rules section shows "No rules discovered yet":

1. **Check if you have enough data:**
   - Rules require at least 10-20 decisions with 1h actual returns
   - Check `/api/rl-agent/rules` endpoint for diagnostic info

2. **Run backfill if needed:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/backfill_prediction_actuals.py
   ```

3. **Rules extraction works with 1h returns:**
   - You don't need to wait 24 hours - rules can be extracted after 1 hour
   - The system will automatically extract rules when enough data is available

### API Endpoints

The application provides API endpoints for programmatic access to data. Some endpoints may be deprecated - see [DEPRECATED.md](DEPRECATED.md) for details on deprecated endpoints.

**RL Agent Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/rl-agent/predictions` - Get multi-horizon return predictions and accuracy stats
- `GET /api/rl-agent/attention` - Get attention weights and influential headlines
- `GET /api/rl-agent/risk` - Get risk metrics and constraint status
- `GET /api/rl-agent/rules` - Get discovered trading rules
- `GET /api/rl-agent/feature-importance` - Get SHAP feature importance
- `GET/POST /api/rl-agent/decision` - Get latest or make new trading decision

**mSOL Tracking Endpoints:**
- `GET /orca/msol/catchup` - Trigger historical mSOL balance catch-up (returns JSON with status and progress)
- `GET /orca/msol/balance` - Get current mSOL balance and USD value

**Note:** API documentation for deprecated endpoints (price prediction, bandit actions) has been moved to [Documentation/reference/DEPRECATED.md](Documentation/reference/DEPRECATED.md).
